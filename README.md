# Operating systems architecture
     This is a project that simulates the architecture for developing the game Draw It or Lose. The design requirements entailed the expansion of this game to multiple platforms and finding the appropriate storage management, memory management and securing the application from breaches.
     The overall architecture plan was scored well. During this project I expanded my knowledge with the allocation of data between memory and storage management. In order to perfect this submission, I would spend more time getting a detailed invoice written up. There needs to be a  budget discussion with the client. This will avoid conflict upon completion of this game.
